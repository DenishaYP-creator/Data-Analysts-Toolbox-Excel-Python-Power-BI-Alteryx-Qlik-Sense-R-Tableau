# Through the exact same process that we just went over in Module 12 with your own data!

#### Steps ####

# 1. Find some data on Kaggle.com, data.gov, or other great data depositories

# 2. Determine your questions about data you want answered

# 3. Comprehend your dataset

# 4. Check for missing data

# 5. Check for Outliers

# 6. Tidy/manipulate your data  

# 7. Visualize your data

# 8. Perform necessary statistical analyses (Machine learning?? :-)

# 9. Consider future steps, questions, possible analyses

# 10. Post it somewhere!

# WARNING - this will take quite some time to complete, do not expect to get
# through it as quickly as the previous exercises. This is truly the culmination
# of everything that we have been learning throughout this course and a great
# way to show your new skills

# WARNING - The amount of effort you put into this project, the more you will get out
