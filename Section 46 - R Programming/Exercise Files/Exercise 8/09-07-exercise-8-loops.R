#### Exercise 8 - Loops ####

# 1. Make a random value return "Yes! That is right" if it is equal to 35, and 
#       "Sorry, try again" if the random value is not 35. 

# 2. Using a for loop, print each value of the following vector on separate lines.
set.seed(123)
ex_9_1 <- sample(1:500, 10)

# 3. Using "ex_9_1" from above, create a for loop that only prints odd numbers.

# 4. Create a while loop that counts down from a random number to zero and prints
#     that number during each iteration.

# 5. Use a repeat loop that prints out every multiple of 3 up to 99.
